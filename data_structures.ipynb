        "     \n",
        "     Ans3->> The difference between lists and tuples is lists are mutable , meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created whereas, tuples are immutable, so once a tuple is created, its values cannot be modified. Lists are written using square brackets [ ], while tuples use parentheses ( ). Because tuples cannot be changed, they are generally faster and use less memory compared to lists, Lists also support many built-in methods like append(), remove(), and sort(), whereas tuples have only a few methods such as count() and index(). Due to these differences, lists are used when data needs to be updated frequently, while tuples are preferred for storing fixed and constant data.\n",

        "\n",
        "   Ans4->>Dictionaries in Python store data in the form of key-value pairs, where each value is accessed using a unique key instead of an index. Internally, dictionaries use a data structure called a hash table, which maps each key to a specific location in memory using a hash function. This allows Python to retrieve, insert, or update values very quickly, usually in constant time. Each key in a dictionary must be unique and immutable, while the values can be of any data type and can be changed as needed. This method of storing data makes dictionaries highly efficient for tasks that require fast lookups, such as searching for information, counting occurrences, or representing structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Ans5->>we can use set instead of list  when we need to store unique items and avoid duplicates automatically. Sets hold only distinct values, so if same element added more than once, it will appear only once in the set,it provide very fast searching, checking, and membership testing because they use hashing internally, making operations like checking whether an item exists much quicker compared to lists. However, sets do not maintain order, so they are most useful in situations where the order of elements does not matter but uniqueness and speed are important.\n",

        "     The main difference between a string and a list is that strings are immutable and lists are mutable, strings can only store characters, while lists can store multiple data types such as numbers, strings, and even other lists. Due to immutability, strings are more memory-efficient and safer for storing fixed textual data, while lists are more flexible and suitable for dynamic collections.\n",
        "7.  What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     Ans7->>A hash table is a data structure that stores data using a key and a hash function to quickly find the location of the value in memory. In Python, dictionaries use hash tables internally, which is why looking up a value by its key is very fast, usually in O(1) time.\n",

        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "   Ans8->Tuples ensure data integrity  by being immutable,element can't be added, or removed after the tuple is created. This immutability prevents accidental or unauthorized changes to the data, making tuples a reliable choice for storing constant or fixed information,it helps maintain consistency and reduces the chances of errors caused by unintended modifications. Tuples are therefore commonly used to store data that must remain secure and unchanged, ensuring higher data integrity compared to mutable structures like lists.\n",

This makes lists a powerful data structure for handling collections of related but different types of data. This ability to store heterogeneous data is one of the reasons why lists are widely used in Python programming.\n",

        "\n",
        "     Ans11->>Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks because they store data in the form of key–value pairs, allowing information to be accessed quickly using a unique key instead of a numerical index which makes it extremely efficient for tasks that require fast searching, inserting, or updating of data, lists require scanning through elements to find a value, dictionaries can retrieve items almost instantly due to their underlying hash-table structure They are especially useful when dealing with structured data, such as storing student records, product details, or configuration settings, where each piece of information is associated with a meaningful key. This makes dictionaries more organized, faster, and easier to work with compared to lists in many real-world applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "     Ans12-> A tuple would be preferable over a list in a situation where the data must remain constant and should not be changed during the execution of the program. For example, storing fixed information such as the days of the week, the coordinates of a point, or configuration values that should not be modified would be best handled using a tuple. Since tuples are immutable, they help protect the data from accidental modification, ensuring reliability and consistency. This makes tuples ideal for representing data that is meant to be permanent, secure, or used as a constant reference throughout the program.\n",

This built-in property makes sets efficient for tasks like filtering repeated items or performing mathematical operations such as unions and intersections.\n",
